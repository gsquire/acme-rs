# How to setup the project locally

For setting up the project you need to have `cargo` installed, for a detailed information about how to install `cargo` and `rustup` head over to their [guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

This crate also depends on the rust [openssl](https://crates.io/crates/openssl) crate, which needs a native version of `openssl` installed. Till now we did not find a way to set up a working environment under `windows`. If you find a way to set this uper on a windows machine, please let us know.
